# Connect Four

Connect Four is a HTML game I developed for a university module. While I wrote the code, my team produced the game assets and handled other project requirements. The game had to be developed in a week and included the following requirements:

- For kids aged 5-8
- Educational
- Compatible with a 1024Ã—760 tablet
- Customisable
